The project aims to visualize the state-space landscape of cost function for the case of optimization of distance to houses at the presence of one hospital only.
Expected result from the project:
After running the code, beside seeing a grid map of the houses and hospital originally generated by the project as images, project must generate a heat grid map (2d or 3d) as python graph like visualization or image like visualization of the same grid size of houses and hospital, the value of "Heat" in case of 2d graph or Z value in case of 3d Graph will be calculated as sum of Manhattan distances of that one hospital to all the houses.
